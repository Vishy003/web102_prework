Submitted by: **Vishakha**

**Sea Monster Crowdfunding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- ✅ The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
- ✅ The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
- ✅ The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
- ✅ The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- 🔹 Sorting of games to display the top two most funded games using destructuring and spread operator.
- 🔹 Custom styling for better visual appeal.

## Notes

- Initially, understanding how to structure and manipulate DOM elements dynamically using JavaScript required careful attention.
- The ternary operator was helpful in rendering proper grammar based on single vs multiple unfunded games.
- The sorting and destructuring concepts were fun to implement once understood clearly.
- Overall, a good refresher and bridge to more advanced topics like React!
